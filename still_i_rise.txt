You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
# Still I Rise

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

With the certainty of moons,

Still I'll sink.

## Verse 8
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak thatâ€™s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.
